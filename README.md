Treat Yo Self
================

Oh look! It's a Chrome extension that will automatically order a random one-click item from your Amazon Wishlist for you! How dangerous! Seriously, you've been warned: this will literally place an Amazon order for you. It's the equivalent of you visiting your wishlist page, closing your eyes, and clicking randomly on the page... but now in a convenient, automated button form! Enjoy!

So treat yo self! Feel the warmth of instant gratification and consumerism!

Disclaimer: Obviously, I don't take any responsibility for whatever weird orders you place for yourself via this extension. Your desire for things is your own fault. So just enjoy it. For example, I now have a drumset, a white lab coat, and of course a ton of star trek novels from my use of this extension. lol. 

Love,
